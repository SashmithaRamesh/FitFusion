    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p className='font'>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the daily crush of media coverage about obesity, weight, and health, it’s easy for people to feel overwhelmed. But there are simple steps you can take to help keep weight in check and lower the risk of many chronic diseases.
    </p>

    <h2>RESOURCE FOR HEALTHY LIVING</h2>
    <p className='font'>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Healthy Weight Checklist is a resource not only for individuals but also for those helping others stay healthy: Parents, caretakers, teachers, healthcare providers, worksite coordinators, public health practitioners, business and community leaders, and healthcare policymakers.
    </p>

    <br></br>
    <h2>EAT WELL</h2>
    <p className='font'>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calories matter for weight-and some foods make it easier for us to keep our calories in check. Healthy eating is a key to good health as well as maintaining a healthy weight. It’s not only what and how much we eat but also, it seems, how we eat that’s important.
    </p>

    <br></br>
    <h2>WHAT TO EAT</h2>
    <ul className='font'>
      <li>Choose minimally processed, whole foods:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Whole grains (whole wheat, steel cut oats, brown rice, quinoa)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (a colorful variety-not potatoes)</li>
        <li>Whole fruits (not fruit juices)</li>
        <li>Nuts, seeds, beans, and other healthful sources of protein (fish and poultry)</li>
        <li>Plant oils (olive and other vegetable oils)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Drink water or other beverages that are naturally calorie-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <br></br>
    <h2>LIMIT THESE FOODS AND DRINKS</h2>
    <ul className='font'>
      <li>Sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, fruit drinks, sports drinks)</li>
      <li>Fruit juice (no more than a small amount per day)</li>
      <li>Refined grains (white bread, white rice, white pasta) and sweets</li>
      <li>Potatoes (baked or fried)</li>
      <li>Red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and processed meats (salami, ham, bacon, sausage)</li>
      <li>Other highly processed foods, such as fast food</li>
    </ul>

    <br></br>
    <p className='font'>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example of an overall healthy diet is the Harvard School of Public Health’s Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate. The Nutrition Source, a companion website to The Obesity Prevention Source, also offers a quick guide to choosing healthy drinks, as well as recipes and quick tips for eating right.
    </p>

    <br></br>
    <h2>HOW MUCH TO EAT</h2>
    <p className='font'>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how many calories you need each day to lose weight or to stay at a healthy weight. With two out of three U.S. adults overweight or obese, it’s clear that many of us need to eat fewer calories.
    </p>

    <p className='font'>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online calorie-needs calculators are a bit over-generous with their recommendations. And, in practice, it’s hard for people to track the amount of calories they take in each day.
    </p>

    <p className='font'>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better approach: Adopt habits that will help you avoid overeating (see below)-and skip some of the high-calorie, low-nutrient foods that are most strongly linked to weight gain, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, and potatoes.
    </p>

    <br></br>
    <h2>HOW TO AVOID OVEREATING</h2>
    <ul className='font'>
      <li>Eat breakfast. While it seems like skipping a meal is an easy way to cut calories, skipping breakfast usually backfires when hunger comes raging back mid-day, often leading to overeating.</li>
      <li>Choose small portions and eat slowly. Slowing down at meals and choosing smaller portions can help avoid overeating by giving the brain time to tell the stomach when it’s had enough food. Limiting distractions-turning off the television, computer, or smartphone-can also help us focus on the food.</li>
      <li>Eat at home. Fast food, restaurant meals, and other foods prepared away from home tend to have larger portions and be less nutritious than the foods we cook for ourselves.</li>
      <li>Eat mindfully. Taking time to think about why you’re actually eating is an easy way to avoid needless calories. Hungry? Make the healthiest food and drink choices possible. Not really hungry? Choose something else to do or have a piece of fruit instead of a full meal. When you do eat, focus all of your senses on the food, so that you can truly enjoy what you are eating. More information about mindful eating can be found at The Center for Mindful Eating and the website for the book Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life.</li>
